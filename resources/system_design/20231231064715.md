## Implementation approach

We will utilize Unity with C# to create a 2D card battling game. For the card mechanics and AI, we will use open-source libraries such as C#-based 'UnityCardGameFramework' and 'SimpleCardFramework'. To compile the game into an installable .exe for Windows, we'll use Unity's build settings configured for Windows standalone.

## File list

- Assets/Scripts/Main.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Card.cs
- Assets/Scripts/Player.cs
- Assets/Scripts/GameManager.cs
- Assets/Scripts/UIManager.cs
- Assets/Scripts/AIPlayer.cs

## Data structures and interfaces

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific card game mechanics, including the rules, number of cards, and integration of humor into the gameplay, need to be further developed. A detailed game design document would be beneficial to clarify these aspects.
